- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

Class components provide a bunch of functionality through this single base component, and by creating components as classes, we can set up a data object that our component is concerned with.

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

The three lifecycle methods are mounting phase (this is when our component is built from the ground up, whatever initial data you want aceess to will defined on the constructor.) , updating phase (updating component data by setState being used to change component state causing a re render.) , un-mounting phase (removing component from screen.).

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

Custom hooks allow us to make stateful logic that can be re used throughout an application.

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

It is import to test our apps to reduce the amount of bugs in our production code.
